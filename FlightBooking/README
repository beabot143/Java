The Flight Booking Java Application.

Functionality Overview: 
  A passenger can book a flight and will be issued a ticket if a seat is available 
  at a price point reflecting the passenger's membership status.

This is a very simple model of a flight booking system. 
In our model we have the following high level overview:
  1. Flight
    - flight number
    - origin location
    - destination location
    - departure time
    - capacity
    - number of seats left
    - original price
    
  2. Ticket
    - flight
    - price
    - ticket number
    - passenger
    
  3. Passenger (members/non members)
    - name
    - age
    - years of membership
    
  4. Managers
